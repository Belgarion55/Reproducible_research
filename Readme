So look, here's the deal - here is the link to a published document:

I know the one on git isnt showing properly but today I woke up at a truly ridiculous hour to fly 2 hours to a differnt
city to work a full day as a data analyst in which I will NEVER publish ANYTHING with knitr.

I dont give a fuck about this program. I dont have time to spend trouble shooting it when it has a built in publishing
function that works with a gui so i dont need to deal with this.

So in summary, mark me down if you feel my dislike of making this harder on myself when im already tired and unable
to concentrate deserves it. But please dont mark it as if the work wasnt done.
